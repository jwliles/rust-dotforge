# Current Development Notes

## Project Context
- DotForge: A modern symlink management tool (alternative to GNU Stow)
- Currently working on v0.3.x features
- Recent work: command interface improvements, man page documentation, recursive directory support
- Migrating docs from MkDocs to mdBook

## Recent Implemented Features
- [x] Recursive directory staging with `--recursive` flag
- [x] Configurable directory traversal depth with `--depth=N` option
- [x] Fixed directory structure preservation when recursively staging files
- [x] Fixed `link` command to properly handle linking directories by name
- [x] Improved link command to handle directories correctly during linking
- [x] Binary name aliasing via Cargo.toml `[[bin]]` section (now available as `forge`)

## Issues Fixed
- Fixed files in recursive directory staging being placed in the root of the dotfiles directory
- Fixed `link` command not finding files when specified by directory name
- Fixed errors during directory linking (now directories are handled differently than files)

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Complete transaction safety with rollbacks
- [ ] Shell completion scripts
- [ ] Interactive TUI mode planning

## Next Steps
- Test recursive directory staging with various config directories
- Possibly extend recursive support to other commands (unlink, remove, delete)
- Finish documentation migration
- Complete v0.3.x milestone items
- Begin work on Interactive TUI (v0.4.x)

## Development Environment
Last session: fixed recursive directory staging issues and implemented binary aliasing
