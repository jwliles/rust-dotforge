## Forge Pack-and-Go â€“ Development Timeline

### Overview
This timeline synthesizes internal discussions and external feedback to propose a realistic 6-week development plan for the Pack-and-Go feature in Forge. The goal is to balance minimal viable functionality, extensibility, and safety, while respecting the tool's deliberate UX philosophy.

---

### âœ… Phase 1: Foundation & Staging (Week 1)
**Goal:** Create and populate pack staging areas with intent and precision.

- Implement `forge start packing <scope>`
- Create `.forge/tmp/pack/<scope>/files/` and `manifest.toml`
- Implement `forge pack <file>` with absolute â†’ relative copying
- Populate manifest entries with target path and metadata

**Note:** Intentional command friction (`start packing`) prevents misuse.

---

### âœ… Phase 2: Sealing & Cleanup (Week 2)
**Goal:** Let users convert staged packs into portable archives.

- Implement `forge seal`
  - ZIP up staged pack as `.forge/archives/<scope>-YYYY-MM-DD.zip`
  - Include `manifest.toml` in the archive
- Delete staging folder (`.forge/tmp/pack/<scope>`) after sealing

**Note:** Sealing is final. Repacking = new staging session.

---

### âœ… Phase 3: Installation (Week 3)
**Goal:** Allow users to extract and use packs on other systems.

- Implement `forge install <archive.zip>`
  - Extract archive
  - Read `manifest.toml`
  - Symlink files to target paths (with absolute path safety)
- Basic conflict detection: file already exists â†’ skip with warning

**Note:** First major cross-system usage milestone.

---

### âœ… Phase 4: Hashing & Validation (Week 4)
**Goal:** Ensure integrity and support future reproducibility.

- Implement `forge hash` (BLAKE3-based) for files in staging
- Add hashes to `manifest.toml`
- Validate hashes during install
- Detect and report mismatches (non-blocking)

**Note:** Inspired by `gen_readme`, `cargo`, and Vim's `:checkhealth`.

---

### âœ… Phase 5: Repack, Unpack, UX (Week 5)
**Goal:** Improve staging workflow and CLI usability.

- Implement `forge repack <scope>` (overwrite staged files from disk)
- Implement `forge unpack <file>` (remove file from pack)
- Add `forge ?` or `forge status` to check CWD scope
- Polish messages, logs, and CLI help output

**Note:** This phase completes the loop of pack creation, revision, and finalization.

---

### âœ… Phase 6: Robustness & Extras (Week 6+)
**Goal:** Stretch goals and production hardening.

- Manifest validation during install
- Rich conflict handling (`git_origin`, file diff, symlink collision)
- `--dry-run` for install and seal
- GUI integration (Command Assistant, scope switcher)
- Support for `forge sign` (GPG signature generation)

**Note:** Prepare Forge for GUI-first users and broader adoption.

---

### ðŸš§ Dev Risk "Parking Lot"
These features are valuable but deferred until core implementation is stable:

- Hardlinking instead of copying (optimization)
- Deduplication support
- Pack encryption (`age`, GPG symmetric)
- Multi-pack orchestration
- GUI manifest editor

---
