I am building this tool to give myself a better experience with dotfile management. I think this tool could handle all my symlinks instead of just dotfiles. I have many scripts that I use on my system, and having a tool to help manage them would be nice. I find GNU Stow limited and challenging to use. A bare Git repository works well enough, but I would like more control than a simple repository. This is where profiles would come into play. I would set up a scripts folder on my PC, put it under Forge management, and then create a separate folder for my dotfiles and put it under Forge management as well. To manage a specific profile, simply use a CLI flag containing the profile name to unlock the "vault" for modification. That means, forge â€”scripts would open the script directory vault for modification. Where an issue lies is what to do about modifications that happen outside of the Forge interface. Should they be seen as corruption, as changes needing approval, or alert the user to them, but otherwise move along? I think the user should have a setting for them to set as a preference. Notify me when I change a Forge-managed file outside of Forge.
