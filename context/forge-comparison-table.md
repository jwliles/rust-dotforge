# Forge Design Evolution: Original vs New Rust-Based Architecture

## Core Architecture

| **Component** | **Original Go Design** | **Rust Migration** | **Changes** |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Core Architecture** | Monolithic package structure | Core/UI separation with libraries | More modular, better separation of concerns |
| **Language** | Go 1.23 | Rust | Memory safety, performance improvements |
| **Configuration** | Flat files in home directory | SQLite database in ~/.config | Centralized, relational data, better query support |
| **Interface** | CLI only | CLI + TUI | Enhanced visual management capabilities |

## Key Features

| **Feature** | **Original Go Design** | **Rust Migration** | **Changes** |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Symlink Management** | Basic creation and tracking | Enhanced workflow (Untracked → Heated → Forged) | More intuitive staging process, better status tracking |
| **Profiles** | Not implemented | Core feature with nested support | Organize related files, better context management |
| **Git Integration** | Not implemented | Task-focused commands | Version control with user-friendly interface |
| **Virtual Environments** | Not implemented | Safe experimentation | Test changes without affecting production environment |
| **Directory Scope** | Limited focus on dotfiles | System-wide symlink management | Manage scripts, executables, and any symlinked content |

## Implementation Details

| **Component** | **Original Go Design** | **Rust Migration** | **Changes** |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Error Handling** | Basic error reporting | Rust's Result type | More robust error management |
| **Path Handling** | Fragile, OS-specific | Cross-platform abstractions | Better handling of path differences between platforms |
| **State Management** | File-based, fragile | Database-driven transactions | Atomic operations, prevents partial updates |
| **Testing** | Minimal test files | Comprehensive testing strategy | Better reliability and fewer bugs |
| **User Feedback** | Text output | Interactive display (TUI) | Better visibility into operations |

## User Experience

| **Aspect** | **Original Go Design** | **Rust Migration** | **Changes** |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Commands** | Fixed set of commands | Extensible command system | More flexibility and future growth |
| **Discoverability** | Help text | TUI with visual navigation | Easier to learn and use |
| **Metaphor** | Generic symlink tool | "Forge" metaphor (heat, forge, cool) | More cohesive conceptual framework |
| **Feedback** | Text-based | Visual progress and status | Better understanding of operations |
| **Safety** | Basic safeguards | Comprehensive validation | Prevents destructive operations |
